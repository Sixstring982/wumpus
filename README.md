# Hunt The Wumpus

Taken from https://www.reddit.com/r/dailyprogrammer/comments/21kqjq/4282014_challenge_154_hard_wumpus_cave_game/

This is a C++ implementation of Hunt The Wumpus.
So far it's incomplete, so I'll add more to the
README when I get closer to finishing.

## Dependencies

So far, you'll need the following in order to build
the game:

  * make
  * clang++-3.5
  * pthreads
  * SDL2
  * OpenGL >= 2.0
  * GLEW

## Building

Just run `make` to build the game. It'll show up as
an executable in the `./bin/` directory.
